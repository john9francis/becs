# becs

Becs stands for "Basic ECS" which stands for "Basic Entity Component System." Becs is an ecs game engine.

The idea of an ECS game engine is grouping functions together in memory.

The difficulty with an ECS modular system is that ECS as a design pattern not very object oriented, it's data oriented. This will require a whole new paradigm of coding. 

# Goals:
- [ ] Get the ecs game engine working
- [ ] Connect up a GUI
- [ ] Allow for a fast mode which doesn't render anything (for physics) and a game mode that renders
- [ ] Add bindings for other languages
